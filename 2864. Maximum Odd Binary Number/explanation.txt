Problem:

Given a binary string s containing at least one 1, the task is to rearrange the bits to form the maximum odd binary number possible. The resulting string can have leading zeros.
Example:
Input: "010"
Output: "001" (Explanation: The only "1" is placed at the end, making the largest odd number)
Input: "101"
Output: "1001" (Explanation: One "1" is placed at the beginning, and the remaining bits form the largest even number "00")

Algorithm:

Count the number of '1's: Iterate through the string and count the occurrences of the character '1'. Store this count in a variable ones_count.
Initialize the result string: Create an empty string named result to store the rearranged binary number.
Append leading zeros (optional): If ones_count is less than the length of the input string s, it means there are leading zeros. Append s.length() - ones_count number of '0' characters to the beginning of result.
Append maximum number with remaining bits:
Add ones_count - 1 '1' characters to the end of result (one less than the total '1's to account for the odd number at the end).
Append s.length() - ones_count '0' characters to the end of result (remaining bits).
Append the last '1': Add a final '1' character to the end of result.

Explanation:

The algorithm first identifies the total number of '1's in the string.
If there are leading zeros, it ensures they are included in the result by adding the required number of '0's at the beginning.
The algorithm then builds the maximum even number using the remaining bits (excluding the last '1'). This is achieved by adding ones_count - 1 '1's followed by the remaining '0's.
Finally, the algorithm appends the remaining '1' to the end, making the resulting number odd and maximizing its value.
This approach ensures that all available '1's are used efficiently to create the largest possible odd binary number from the given string.
